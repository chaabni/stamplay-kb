stamplay-knowledge-base
===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to show you how to build community platform like, similar to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).**


In this project weâ€™ll show you how to build a community platform that:

* lets guest users read and search every question available on the website
* lets guest users signup using their GitHub account to interact with the content of the website
* lets logged in users ask a new question to the community
* lets logged in users upvote or down vote a solution to a question
* lets logged in users discuss questions in a comment thread

[This is what you'll build](https://stamplaykb.stamplayapp.com/#/).
